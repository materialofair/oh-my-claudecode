# Skill Debugger

Systematic debugging tool for Claude Code skills that aren't triggering as expected. Identifies root causes like poor descriptions, missing trigger words, naming issues, or skill discovery problems.

## Agent Workflow

To debug effectively, follow this **Hybrid Workflow**:

1.  **Fact Check (Hard Metrics)**: Use `Glob` and `Read` tools to verify the **target skill's** implementation.
    *   Does the folder exist?
    *   Does `SKILL.md` exist?
    *   Is the YAML frontmatter valid?
2.  **Context Analysis (Soft Metrics)**: Compare the **target skill's** description with the **user's recent prompts**.
    *   *Agent Cognition*: "The user asked for 'finance help', but the skill description only says 'data analysis'. That's why it didn't trigger."
3.  **Synthesize**: Report the factual findings (e.g., "File exists") + your semantic diagnosis (e.g., "Description is too vague").

## Capabilities

- **Trigger Analysis**: Examines why a skill isn't being invoked when it should be
- **Description Evaluation**: Checks if skill description clearly communicates when to use it
- **Keyword Detection**: Identifies missing or weak trigger keywords in descriptions
- **Discovery Debugging**: Verifies Claude Code can find and load the skill
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifies skills with overlapping triggers or descriptions
- **YAML Validation**: Checks frontmatter format and required fields
- **Interactive Diagnosis**: Guides through systematic debugging steps
- **Fix Suggestions**: Provides specific improvements to enhance skill triggering

## Common Skill Triggering Problems

### Problem 1: Vague Description
**Symptom**: Skill exists but Claude Code never uses it
**Root Cause**: Description doesn't mention specific use cases or keywords
**Example**:
```yaml
description: Helps with various tasks  ❌ Too vague
description: Analyzes financial ratios from statement data for investment decisions  ✅ Specific
```

### Problem 2: No Clear Trigger Words
**Symptom**: Need to explicitly mention skill name to invoke it
**Root Cause**: Description lacks keywords that match user queries
**Fix**: Add trigger keywords like "financial analysis", "investment", "ratios"

### Problem 3: Skill Not Discovered
**Symptom**: Claude Code says skill doesn't exist
**Root Cause**: Wrong installation location or invalid SKILL.md
**Check**: `~/.claude/skills/[name]/SKILL.md` or project-local `.claude/skills/[name]/SKILL.md`

### Problem 4: Name Mismatch
**Symptom**: Skill found but not loaded
**Root Cause**: YAML `name` doesn't match folder name
**Fix**: Ensure `name: skill-name` matches folder `skill-name/`

### Problem 5: Overlapping Skills
**Symptom**: Wrong skill triggers instead
**Root Cause**: Multiple skills with similar descriptions
**Fix**: Make each description unique and specific

## Input Requirements

**Basic Debugging**:
- Skill name or path
- Expected trigger scenario (what you asked that should have triggered it)

**Deep Analysis**:
- All installed skills paths (for conflict detection)
- Recent conversation history (to see what Claude Code chose instead)

## Output Formats

**Quick Diagnosis**:
```
Skill: code-review
Status: ❌ Not triggering
Root Cause: Description too generic
Fix: Add specific keywords like "review", "code quality", "pull request"
```

**Detailed Report**:
```
=== Skill Debugging Report ===

Skill: financial-analyzer
Path: ~/.claude/skills/financial-analyzer/
Status: ⚠️ Rarely triggers

Issues Found:
1. [CRITICAL] Description missing use case keywords
   - Current: "Analyzes financial data"
   - Should mention: financial ratios, investment analysis, DCF, valuation

2. [HIGH] No "When to Use" section in SKILL.md
   - Claude Code can't determine clear triggering conditions

3. [MEDIUM] Overlaps with "data-analyzer" skill
   - Both mention "analyzes data"
   - Make this one specific to finance

Recommendations:
1. Update description to: "Calculates financial ratios and performs DCF valuation analysis for investment decisions"
2. Add "When to Use" section with examples: "when analyzing company financials", "for investment analysis"
3. Differentiate from data-analyzer by focusing on financial metrics

Expected Improvement: 90% better triggering with these fixes
```

**Conflict Matrix**:
```
Skills with Overlapping Triggers:

code-review  ←→  quality-analyzer  (both mention "code quality")
  Fix: code-review for PRs, quality-analyzer for metrics

data-analyzer  ←→  financial-analyzer  (both mention "analysis")
  Fix: Make financial-analyzer specific to finance keywords
```

## Debugging Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Skill Exists

```
"Check if my code-review skill is installed correctly"
"Is the financial-analyzer skill discoverable?"
```

Claude Code will:
- Check file exists at expected location
- Validate SKILL.md format
- Verify YAML frontmatter

### Step 2: Analyze Description Quality

```
"Why isn't my code-review skill triggering?"
"Debug the financial-analyzer skill - I asked about ratios but it didn't trigger"
```

Claude Code will:
- Examine description for specificity
- Check for relevant keywords
- Compare against your query

### Step 3: Test Trigger Scenarios

```
"What should I ask to trigger the code-review skill?"
"Give me 5 phrases that should invoke financial-analyzer"
```

Claude Code will:
- Generate test queries based on description
- Identify gaps between description and intended use
- Suggest description improvements

### Step 4: Check for Conflicts

```
"Do any of my skills conflict with code-review?"
"Why does data-analyzer trigger instead of financial-analyzer?"
```

Claude Code will:
- Compare all skill descriptions
- Identify overlapping keywords
- Suggest differentiation strategies

## Systematic Debugging Questions

When a skill isn't triggering, Claude Code will check:

1. **Installation Check**
   - "Is the skill at `~/.claude/skills/[name]/SKILL.md` or `.claude/skills/[name]/SKILL.md`?"
   - "Does the skill folder exist?"

2. **YAML Validation**
   - "Is the YAML frontmatter properly formatted with `---` delimiters?"
   - "Does the `name:` field match the folder name?"
   - "Is there a `description:` field?"

3. **Description Quality**
   - "Does the description mention specific use cases?"
   - "Does it include keywords you'd naturally use?"
   - "Is it specific enough to avoid confusion with other skills?"

4. **Content Analysis**
   - "Is there a 'When to Use' or 'Use Cases' section?"
   - "Are there clear usage examples?"
   - "Does the first paragraph explain the purpose?"

5. **Conflict Check**
   - "Do other skills have similar descriptions?"
   - "Which skill actually triggered instead?"
   - "How can we differentiate this skill?"

## How to Use

**Quick Fix**:
```
"My code-review skill isn't working"
"Why doesn't Claude Code use my financial-analyzer?"
"Debug skill triggering for aws-solution-architect"
```

**Detailed Analysis**:
```
"I asked 'analyze this company's financials' but financial-analyzer didn't trigger. Debug it."
"Compare my code-review and quality-analyzer skills - which should trigger when?"
```

**Preventive Check**:
```
"Before I install this skill, check if it will trigger correctly"
"Will my new skill conflict with existing ones?"
```

## Common Fixes (By Root Cause)

### Fix 1: Improve Description Specificity
**Before**: `description: Helps with code analysis`
**After**: `description: Performs static code quality analysis with metrics calculation and refactoring suggestions`

### Fix 2: Add Trigger Keywords
Add words users would naturally say:
- Financial skill: "ratios", "valuation", "DCF", "investment"
- Code skill: "review", "quality", "refactor", "analyze code"
- Data skill: "visualization", "trends", "insights", "dashboard"

### Fix 3: Add "When to Use" Section
```markdown
## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- Analyze company financial statements
- Calculate financial ratios (P/E, ROE, ROA, etc.)
- Perform DCF valuation
- Make investment decisions based on financial data
```

### Fix 4: Differentiate from Similar Skills
If you have `data-analyzer` and `financial-analyzer`:
- data-analyzer: "for general data analysis and visualization"
- financial-analyzer: "specifically for financial statement analysis and investment metrics"

### Fix 5: Fix Name Mismatch
Ensure folder name matches YAML name:
```
Folder: ~/.claude/skills/code-review/
YAML: name: code-review  ✅

Folder: ~/.claude/skills/code-review/
YAML: name: code_review  ❌ Mismatch!
```

## Diagnostic Checklist

When debugging, Claude Code will check:

- [ ] Skill file exists at correct location
- [ ] SKILL.md has valid YAML frontmatter
- [ ] `name` in YAML matches folder name
- [ ] `description` is 50-150 characters
- [ ] Description includes specific use case keywords
- [ ] Description mentions when/what/who/why
- [ ] No vague words (helps, assists, various, many)
- [ ] "When to Use" or similar section exists
- [ ] At least 3 usage examples present
- [ ] No conflicts with other skill descriptions
- [ ] Trigger keywords match natural language queries

## Integration with Other Skills

**Works with skill-quality-analyzer**:
```
"Run quality analysis on financial-analyzer then debug why it's not triggering"
```

**Works with skill-tester**:
```
"Test if code-review skill triggers for 'review this PR'"
```

**Workflow**:
1. skill-debugger: Identify why not triggering
2. skill-quality-analyzer: Check overall quality
3. Fix issues
4. skill-tester: Verify fix works

## Limitations

- **Cannot Read Claude Code's Internal Decision Process**: Can only infer based on descriptions
- **No Real-Time Monitoring**: Can't watch skill selection in action
- **Heuristic-Based**: Uses patterns, not guaranteed 100% accurate
- **No Auto-Fix**: Provides recommendations but you must apply them
- **Context-Dependent**: Triggering also depends on conversation context

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- **Skill Works Fine**: No debugging needed
- **Skill Execution Errors**: Use skill-tester for runtime issues
- **Documentation Issues**: Use documentation tools
- **Quality Problems**: Use skill-quality-analyzer

## Success Metrics

After applying fixes, skill should trigger when:
- User query contains description keywords
- Use case matches "When to Use" section
- No more specific skill exists for the query

**Expected Trigger Rate**: 80-90% when query clearly matches intended use case

## Pro Tips

1. **Test Your Descriptions**: Ask "Would I say this naturally?"
2. **Be Specific**: "financial ratio calculation" > "data analysis"
3. **Avoid Overlaps**: Each skill should have unique keywords
4. **Use Examples**: Add 5+ usage examples in SKILL.md
5. **Think Like Users**: What would you actually ask?
6. **Regular Audits**: Run debugger on all skills monthly
7. **Version Descriptions**: Track what works over time

## Claude Code Specific Notes

- Skills are discovered from `~/.claude/skills/` and `.claude/skills/` in project root
- Use `Glob` tool to search for skills: `Glob(pattern="**/SKILL.md")`
- Use `Read` tool to examine skill content
- Skill invocation uses the `Skill` tool with skill name parameter
